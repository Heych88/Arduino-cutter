// Use a NeoPixel RGB LED and light sensor on the Circuit Playground board to
// do basic color detection.  By quickly flashing full red, green, and blue color
// light from the NeoPixel the light sensor can read the intensity of the
// reflected light and roughly approximate the color of the object.
//
// After uploading the sketch to Circuit Playground you can press and release the
// left or right button to do a color sense and print the red, green, blue component
// values to the serial monitor (115200 baud).  In addition all the NeoPixels on
// the board will be lit up to the detected color.  You should hold a brightly
// colored object right above the light sensor and NeoPixel #1 (upper
// left part of board, look for the eye symbol next to the color sensor) when
// performing the color sense.
